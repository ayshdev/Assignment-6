<h1 style="font-size: 50px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id="syn"> <u>Synopsis</u></h1> 
<hr>
<h2 id="set">Setting</h2>
<p>
    In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters: onryō (vengeful spirit), yūrei (ghosts), and yōkai. <br><br><br>
    Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who have the ability to control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the Domain, all of their attacks are guaranteed to hit and will grow in strength. <br>
</p>
<br>
<h2 id="plo">Plot</h2>
<p>Yuji Itadori is a high school student with unnatural physical strength. One day at school, his friends attract Curses by unsealing a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer student Megumi Fushiguro—on site to retrieve the finger—unwittingly becoming host to the powerful ancient sorcerer Ryomen Sukuna. All sorcerers must exorcise Sukuna, and Yuji by extension. However, noticing his capability to retain control over his body, Satoru Gojo—Megumi's teacher and the strongest sorcerer in the modern Jujutsu world—brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School to train him. Gojo has Yuji's execution postponed until he consumes all twenty of Sukuna's fingers, so the Curse can be eliminated permanently with his death. <br><br><br>
    Meanwhile, a group of intelligent Cursed Spirits plot an elaborate attack to reform the Jujutsu world as they see fit, starting with sealing Gojo away, as he is too strong to kill and his presence maintains order in the Jujutsu world. The group is led by mysterious sorcerer and Curse User Suguru Geto, supposedly killed by Gojo a year prior. His entourage includes the sadistic Curse Mahito, fire Curse Jogo, and nature Curse Hanami. Gojo's class of first-years—Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara Kugisaki—are trained by going on missions to exorcise low-level Curses; during these, Sukuna takes an interest in Megumi, due to his power and potential. Yuji is devastated after Mahito kills his friend Junpei Yoshino, experiencing first-hand the harsh reality of the Jujutsu world he has become part of. During a competition between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools, Mahito steals three "Death Paintings"—half-human half-Curses—from the Tokyo school, summoning them to their full form. Yuji and Nobara kill two of them during a mission, leaving Choso as the sole surviving Death Painting. <br><br><br>
    With the help of his allies, Yuji is able to overpower Sukuna, although Choso sacrifices himself in the process. Sukuna is surprised by Gojo's reappearance, who is actually Yuta inside Gojo's corpse by means of copying Kenjaku's Cursed Technique to switch bodies. Yuji activates his Domain Expansion; within it, he takes Sukuna on a journey through his hometown, fruitlessly attempting to reason with him. Yuji converses with Megumi's soul, inspiring him to fight back. Sukuna notices that Yuji is missing another finger besides the one he tore off to possess Megumi; said finger was used to allow Yuta to activate the Cursed Technique, and Sukuna was bluffed into believing that his own last finger was used instead. Nobara arrives where Gojo hid Sukuna's real last finger, using her Cursed Technique to strike it, simultaneously attacking Sukuna's soul, and Yuji takes the opportunity to give him a final blow. Megumi frees himself from Sukuna, who disintegrates away after refusing a final chance from Yuji.
